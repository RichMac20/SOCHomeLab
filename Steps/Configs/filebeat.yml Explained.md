- Explanation:
  - Type: Log
    - Tells filebeat the type is a Log (Any file that contains logs, including JSON)
  - Enabled: True
    - Actives input and collection
  - Paths:
    - Specifies the path 
  - Fields: 
    - Log_type: (Example)
      - Creates a field titled log_type, allows Splunk to parse for that field type and find data collected from that specific tool
  - fields _under_root: true 
    - Puts custom field (Log_type) to top level instead of being nested under fields:
      - Example:	
        - Instead of field: { "fields": { "log_type": "wazuh" } }
        - It looks like: { "log_type": "wazuh" }
  - Json.keys_under_root: true:
    - Does the same as fields _under_root: true, just with json instead of fields
  - Json.add_error_key: true:
    - Adds key if there is an issue with the logs, can help with log error troubleshooting
  - Codec: json_lines:
    - Sends each log event as a properly delimited JSON line
      - Makes the logs human readable and easily parsable
  - Output.logstash
    - Used logstash (Data processing pipeline tool used to collect, process, and forward logs/events from sources to a destination) 
      - Host: [“192.168.150.10:5044”] 
        - Sending to Security Onion port 5044 (Port Logstash listens on)
          - Note: Using logstash because it supports a splunk_hec plugin
