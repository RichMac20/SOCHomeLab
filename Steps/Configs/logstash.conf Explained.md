# Note: Whitespace isn't Important When Using JSON
- Explanation:
  - Input { beats { port => 5044}} 
    - Sets logstash to listen on port 5044 for data from Filebeat
  - Filter:
    - Json { source/target}:
      - Filters the input from Filebeat into json format and changes the name of the message
    - Mutate { rename}:
      - Renames parsed_json to message again
  - Output:
    - Stdout { codec => rubydebug }
      - Used to debug issues with Logstash
        - Logstash uses JRuby 
          - JRuby has compatibility issues with the Security Onion iso / Linux library version I have, thus the need to use a docker instance to isolate the library. 
    - Splunk_hec:
      - Sends processed data to Splunk HEC
    - Hec_host:
      - Specifies host
    - Port:
      - Default port for HEC is 8088
    - Hec_token:
      - Token for the HEC configured
        - Note: Will be a different HEC Token generated when creating a HEC instance, use the one that you created
          - Found in Settings > Data Inputs > HEC > Show Token
    - Index:
      - Sending to configured index 
    - Sourcetype => “_json”
      - Specifies to send in json (Which is default behavior for HEC anyway)
